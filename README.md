# nb-short-project-name-plugin

Special thanks to @jtulach for making this happen.

This is a NetBeans plugin that addresses the issue as described in 194773 bug report (https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=194773). It creates a new window that all projects are displayed with their sort name (artifact Id).

In the file browser, go to the directory in which you have extracted the contents of the NetBeans Plugins.
